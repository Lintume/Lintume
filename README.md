A passionate and language agnostic _Software Developer_, advocate for lifelong learning and hard work. For me, programming is a natural extension of me. It is difficult for me to separate myself from programming and everything related to computers. I've spent the better part of my life messing around with computers and code, and even if I'd go exploring different career paths (music, photography, retail), I'd always come back to coding. Wrote my first line of code at the age of 13 (Visual Basic), later created some PHP4/MySQL websites for about a year, done a lot of computer troubleshooting for myself, friends and family. Of course, I broke loads of stuff as well... I blame curiosity.

A few years back I got a Master's degree in Information Security at the Kharkiv University of Radioelectronics. There I wrote my first programs on C++. I wrote implementations of encryption algorithms, and the culmination of my studies was the creation of my own, albeit not very complex, but working fast steganographic encryption algorithm on PHP and an analyzer of its effectiveness, which is still available as a website.
While studying at the university, I found my first job on WordPress, but I quickly got bored with it and decided to learn Laravel and Vue.js.
After studying Laravel, I found a job in a Ukrainian product - the International Arts Championship. In a year and a half, I learned to do everything - from setting up servers to Google optimization (the specifics of small product companies with a small budget).
My next company was Sitecraft, where I worked as an outstaff for a Canadian customer for almost 4 years. During this time, I wrote many projects - complex and not so, in the team and myself. But basically all projects were custom and required constant growth as a developer.

While working at Sitecraft, I became interested in the topic of proper nutrition and wrote my own tool for monitoring nutrition and my indicators.

This summer, I finished working for Sitecraft and a Canadian customer, because they had no more suitable projects for me.

I am currently actively looking for a job.
## Skills

#### Software development
- **Languages/Technologies** - PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, Laravel 5+, PostgreSQL, Git, Vue.js, DevOps, Linux, MacOS, JQuery, Docker, ะก++, AWS, BitBucket, Symfony 3, WordPress, non-relational databases and more...
- **Fast learner** - Able to grasp new concepts and technologies really quickly. During the course at Makers Academy, I chose to do team projects in (at the time) unknown languages to boost my learning ability and explore other technologies/languages. Got my first developer job to code in a language I've never touched before (C#).
- **Debugging** - Able to follow to flow of the program, read the stack trace, hunt down and exterminate any bugs. A keen eye for typos, missing keywords, etc. Although my typing is pretty accurate and the number of typos is very minimal.
- **Researching** - I found that gazing at the screen doesn't do much, so I've befriended Google and StackOverflow to help me get through the "I don't know" phase. Able to research, read, and make sense of any documentation. If not, I can always experiment in a REPL, "connect the dots" and make sense of how things work.
- **Problem solving** - There's always a way. Pen & paper help me get through the initial phase of "where do I start??", domain modelling, user stories, etc.

#### Personal traits
- **Passionate** - I love learning, and I love developing software. I am fascinated by all things technology, and I know I will be developing software that will shape the future.
- **Humble** - In my humble opinion...
- **Patient** - So I've been told... Does not apply to slow technology (computer, internet connection, etc.)
- **Team worker** - Able to work in a team or alone. At Makers Academy, most of my time was spent pair-programming, of which 4 weeks were spent in a team environment where I'd develop software in teams of 4 people. On my first job I've worked in a much larger team, where communication was essential to delivering satisfactory results. Currently I work in a team of 3, where we all collaborate on everything from infrastructure design to the final code.
- **Communication** - Having pair-programmed in expirience, I have learned to effectively communicate technical terms and ideas to my pair partner, as well as understanding the ideas being communicated to me.
