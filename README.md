# Lialia Sakhno

> _Currently working as Engineer, AI Product at [Landscape VC](https://www.landscape.vc/)_

A passionate Software Developer and firm believer in lifelong learning. For me, programming is a natural extension of who I am ‚Äî it's difficult to separate myself from code and everything related to computers. I've spent the better part of my life exploring technology, and even when I've ventured into other fields (music, photography, retail), I always return to coding. I wrote my first line of code at 13 in Visual Basic, and the journey has been extraordinary ever since.

## About Me

I hold a Master's degree in Information Security from Kharkiv University of Radioelectronics, where I developed my foundational skills in C++ and created a custom [PHP steganography encoder-decoder and analyzer](https://github.com/Lintume/Stego-analyzer) based on the LSB algorithm for my thesis.

My professional journey began with a Ukrainian startup, **International Arts Championship**, where I wore many hats ‚Äî from server configuration to SEO optimization. This experience taught me the full spectrum of web development.

At **Sitecraft**, I spent nearly 4 years as an outstaff developer for Canadian clients, building both simple and complex custom solutions that pushed my growth as a developer. During this time, I also developed [Calorize](https://calorize.com.ua), a personal nutrition and health tracking tool.

My experience at **[OpenDialog AI](https://opendialog.ai/)** introduced me to the exciting world of conversational AI, where I built core backend logic using NLP and LLM integrations. At **[Cedoon](https://cedoon.com/)**, I became a lead contributor in a high-performing team, discovering the elegance of Livewire and Alpine.js while building real-time features.

Currently at **[Landscape VC](https://www.landscape.vc/)**, I'm building AI-first tools for investors, designing memory systems for agents, and orchestrating tools with modern LLMs. This role perfectly combines my passion for engineering with cutting-edge AI technology.
